<p>So they don’t lose their way, Hansel and Ellie drop breadcrumbs as they walk. They need one breadcrumb for every 5 steps they take. It takes 30 steps to get to the end of the path.
</p>
<p>If they drop < __ breadcrumbs they haven’t got far enough.</p>
<p>If they drop = __ breadcrumbs they get to the house.</p>
<p>Else they have gone too far.</p>
